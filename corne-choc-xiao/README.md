Here's some gerbers to get yourself into trouble with. You should be able to just drop the gerber zip file into JLCPCB. If you also want to have some of the 
PCBA done, I've included a BOM and CPL that has all the info for the diodes and the battery connector.

SVG files can be imported into Fusion 360 to create a sketch to start the case making fun. They are pulled from the PCB Edge Cuts.

***EDIT***

03/12/23 added in ZMK starter files. These should go in the boards/sheilds directory of your ZMK branch. Then go in and modify the build.yml to include it.

If you get stuck on anything, the ZMK discord is very helpful.
