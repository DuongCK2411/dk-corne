Removed the TRRS jack, Added power switch, place to solder battery (soldering directly to the controller will bypass the power switch) and support for the Nice!View.
I reused the Data Pin on the Sofle (D2 on the Pro Micro P0.08 on the Nice!Nano) for the CS pin on the Nice!View. LED pin and connections are still intact in case you want to use that.

This was routed using Freerouting. Gerbers/BOM/CPL were generated with JLCPCB Kicad Plugin. It is currently untested.
