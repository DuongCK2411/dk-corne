###Update as of 03/06/23###
I had some of these made and I built one. Pics to follow when I have a chance, but this is confirmed as working. No issues so far. Displays and all. I will also try to post the basic ZMK files needed to get this up and running.
###End update####

Modified the original from a direct pin setup to a matrix with XIAO controllers. Removed the TRRS, added power switch (Note the board will not charge unless the power switch is in the on position) and added a place to connect a battery. 

Original can be found here: https://github.com/toniz4/tenax

This was mostly routed using Freerouting. Gerbers/BOM/CPL were auto generated by the JLCPCB Kicad Plugin.

There is an issue with the way the footprints lined up for the CPL file. I wouldn't recommend using it at this time.
