Modified the original from a direct pin setup to a matrix with XIAO controllers. Removed the TRRS, added power switch (Note the board will not charge unless the power switch is in the on position) and added a place to connect a battery.

This was mostly routed using Freerouting. Gerbers/BOM/CPL were auto generated by the JLCPCB Kicad Plugin.

There is an issue with the way the footprints lined up for the CPL file. I wouldn't recommend using it at this time.
