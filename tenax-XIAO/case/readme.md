This is my initial attempt at a case. It's the same as the one in baby blue in the build pics. 
It is basically just an upper shell/plate. There is no baseplate to go on the bottom. The shell supports it.
I have only printed this at home with a resin 3D printer (Elegoo Saturn).
Use at your own risk.
